# CMPE-148 Lab 2

Put an HTML file (e.g., HelloWorld.html) in the same directory that the server is in. Run the server
program. Determine the IP address of the host that is running the server (e.g., 128.238.251.26). From
another host, open a browser and provide the corresponding URL. For example:
http://128.238.251.26:6789/HelloWorld.html
‘HelloWorld.html’ is the name of the file you placed in the server directory. Note also the use of the port
number after the colon. You need to replace this port number with whatever port you have used in the
server code. In the above example, we have used the port number 6789. The browser should then display
the contents of HelloWorld.html. If you omit ":6789", the browser will assume port 80 and you will get
the web page from the server only if your server is listening at port 80.
Then try to get a file that is not present at the server. You should get a “404 Not Found” message

The html file I have added here is HelloWorld.
And the IP address was 10.0.0.171:portNumber.

portNumber = 7000 that I used.

So, open the browser and provide: 10.0.0.171/HelloWorld.html
